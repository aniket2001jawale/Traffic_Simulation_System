# Traffic_Simulation_System  

## Description
This project simulates traffic flow at intersections and roads using C++. 
It models vehicle movement, traffic lights, and basic congestion patterns. 
The simulation helps visualize traffic behavior and analyze traffic flow.

## Features
- Vehicle movement simulation
- Traffic light control
- Console or simple graphical visualization
- Configurable number of vehicles and roads

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Standard C++ library
- Optional: Graphics library if GUI is implemented (e.g., SFML)

## How to Compile & Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aniket2001jawale/Traffic_Simulation_System.git

2. Navigate to the folder:
   cd trafficsimulation

3. Compile the program:
   g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp TrafficLight.cpp Vehicle.cpp Road.cpp Intersection.cpp -o TrafficSimulation.exe

4. Run the simulation:
   ./TrafficSimulation
